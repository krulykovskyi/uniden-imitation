# uniden-imitation

Simple script that copies files from folder named "recs-source" to folder named "REC"

To use it properly:
 - you should have `node` and `npm` installed
 - `uniden-imitation` folder must be in the same folder as `recs-source` and `REC`
 - open terminal and run `npm install` inside `uniden-imitation` folder
 - after external packages installed run `node index.js`

Script will work until you interrupt process or close terminal window
